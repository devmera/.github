## Our story 🚀

Devmera offers expert IT consulting services focused on helping businesses modernize and optimize their technical environment. We have extensive experience in development and project management within IT projects for various industry-related companies.

We provide expertise in a variety of categories:

### Kubernetes 🐳

Need help with setting up new production-ready Kubernetes clusters or managing existing ones? With our extensive knowledge of Kubernetes, we'll assist you with all the tooling and best practices that make a successful setup. Need custom controllers or operators? We can help with that too.

### Software Development 💻

At the heart of any software lies clean, performant, and beautiful code with best practices that should live for years to come. We know things like Go, NodeJS, Java, C#, React, and NextJS. Do you use microservices and event-driven patterns? No problem!

### Platform Engineering 🛠️

We'll help you with all the tools you need to succeed with your platform engineering journey. We have experience setting up and managing tools like Backstage, ArgoCD, Crossplane, Terraform, Linkerd, Helm, and many more.

### AWS ☁️

Want to move to the cloud or already made the big step and need support with your setup? At Devmera, we have documented experience in managing everything from smaller workloads to enterprises in AWS. We'll help you with everything from setting up your infrastructure to migrating your existing workloads.

### Open Source ❤️

Navigating the world of open-source software can be overwhelming. We have over a decade of experience working with open-source projects. Need to contribute to an existing project to better fit your needs? We got you!
